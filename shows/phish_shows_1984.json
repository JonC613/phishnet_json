This show featured the first known performance of Camel Walk and the first known Phish performances of Wild Child, Bertha, Can&#39;t You Hear Me Knocking, Eyes of the World, and Whipping Post (which featured Jeff on vocals). CYHMK included a St. Stephen tease. Copies of this performance often circulate with the incorrect date of November 3, 1983. Also, it is possible that this show was actually on Friday, November 2, 1984, as a photo of a flyer for a show on &ldquo;11/2&rdquo; was printed in <em>The Phish Book</em>.",

Spanish Flea included an introduction of the band members. Don&rsquo;t Want You No More was not performed in its entirety, as it lacked the final lyrics. The lengthy percussion jam featured a guest appearance from Marc Daubert. Mike recalls that there were approximately 200 people in the audience. This gig featured the first known version of Slave to the Traffic Light and Fluffhead, the first known Phish versions of Fire, Don&#39;t Want You No More, Cities, and Skippy the Wondermouse, and the only known Phish version of Spanish Flea. This performance was on the upstairs level of Nectar&#39;s.",
