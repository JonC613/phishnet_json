Trey teased Can't You Hear Me Knocking in Birds of a Feather. Lyrics in Makisupa referenced âfatty,â âWaffle House,â and âHooters.â The end of Possum included bizarre on-stage antics with Page playing Treyâs guitar from his seat, Trey playing Mikeâs bass, and Mike using the âBâ and âAhâ cymbals normally reserved for Cracklinâ Rosie. This improvisational Contact continued the joke of mock introductions, as Trey introduced âAl Gore.â",

Instead of emerging from behind the piano with his own microphone for Lawn Boy, Page came front stage and used Treyâs microphone and stand. The move prompted a raucous response from the crowd. Trey teased Oye Como Va and Another One Bites the Dust during YEM. Carolina was played for the first time since November 18, 1998 (146 shows). The YEM vocal jam included a Daniel Saw the Stone tease. Proud Mary was performed <em>a cappella</em> (including renderings of the musical breaks) to conclude the vocal jam. Only one other version of Proud Mary is known â a full-band version at the first ever Phish show on December 2, 1983 (1,379Â shows).",

As homage to the movie <em>Old School </em>(which also featured Dust in the Wind), Trey encouraged the crowd to &ldquo;earmuff&rdquo; it while Dan received his prize. To bring the rest of the crowd in on the joke, Phish subsequently debuted an abbreviated version of Dust in the Wind. The song began as a solo vacuum piece but Trey jumped in on vocals to assist the struggling Fish. Trey teased Come On (Part One) before DWD.&nbsp;DWD&nbsp;contained San-Ho-Zay and Psycho Killer teases and was unfinished. Catapult was sung over the jam that emerged from DWD.

Seven Below contained an On Your Way Down tease,Â Scents and Subtle Sounds included Seven Below teases. Before Dog Log, Trey remarked that the band couldnât figure out what to play, and noted how, on this tour, the band made a conscious effort to not think about what songs they were going to play next. The fourth set âTower Jamâ found Phish playing on top the old air traffic control tower near the concert field. The set consisted of roughly an hourâs worth of unscripted jam material, with no notable teases or jams present. While Phish jammed, Chris Kuroda illuminated the towerâs interior and exterior with a light show and dancers suspended by wires around the side of the tower performed on the structure.",

Trey omitted a verse in Wilson. Afterwards, he announced that it was the âshortest version everâ and dedicated it to Phish archivist Kevin Shapiro. Trey then humorously announced that the band would next play the âlongest Bittersweet Motelâ (traditionally one of the shortest songs in the Phish canon) while Page teased \"Charge!\"Â The crowd responded with a passionate âFluffheadâ chant, but Trey responded: âMike says noâ (prompting laughs from the other band members). Appropriately, Trey launched into Mikeâs Song but Mike had the last laugh: during the Mikeâs Song intro, Mike sang his âHendgeâ lyric that had been omitted from Wilson. YEM contained the event-appropriate lyrical change âBoy, Man, God, IT,â a Frankenstein tease from Mike, and a vocal quote of Daniel Saw the Stone. The band vamped on the theme to <em>Chariots of Fire</em> (a Phish debut) while Trey introduced the top finishers in the Runaway Jim 5K race. During Antelope, Trey thanked the staff, road crew, caterers (âpart of the reason weâre playing so well is because we have the best food this tour that weâve ever hadâ), and fans. He concluded by encouraging everyone to drive safely and noted tongue-in-cheek that next yearâs âIT 2â would have a traffic-free entrance. Antelope also included Under Pressure and Itâs Ice teases.",

Trey also commented on his long-standing friendship with Tom Marshall and said that Tom had written Makisupa when he was a child. Trey brought Tom out on stage and noted that he thought Makisupa was written in 1969, leading Tom to note that we âhave a 60âs song.â Prior to Tom singing on Buffalo Bill, Trey noted: âTom is now going to sing you a song about a boss, a log, and a piece of rope.â",

The music stand held a three-ring binder that contained lyrics from the Phish canon, but it did not play an active role in the performance. Ya Mar contained teases of The Tra La La Song (One Banana, Two Banana). At the end of Disease, a video screen descended behind the stage. As the house lights remained down, a 25+ minute video was played featuring retrospective highlights from throughout Phish&rsquo;s career. Before the second set, Mike brought out a tray of desserts and shared them with fans in front of the stage. Highway to Hell was briefly teased by Trey before Rock and Roll. Weekapaug was unfinished. Tweezer Reprise included lyrics (sung by Trey) from Mike&rsquo;s Song. Appropriately, the post-show house music was the Beatles&rsquo; song Sgt. Pepper&rsquo;s Lonely Heart&rsquo;s Club Band (which begins with the lyric, &ldquo;It was twenty years ago today&hellip;&rdquo;).",

To make it up to the crowd for letting them down, Trey brought out George Clinton and Parliament/Funkadelic (also known as The P. Funk All-Stars). Trey commentedÂ âand thatâs even<em> better</em> than Touch Me!â Page teased Touch Me while Trey was talking. The ensuing P. Funk Jam moved through pieces of several classic Parliament/Funkadelic tunes including Butt-a-Butt, Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof Off the Sucker), P. Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up), and One Nation Under A Groove. Get Low (Lil Jon and the Eastside Boyz) was also part of the medley. By the end of the jam, FishÂ was alone on stage playing vacuum. Fish then exited, leaving the stage empty. Phish returned alone to finish Makisupa; to prove that P. Funk was better than FishÂ singing Touch Me, Makisupa closed with FishÂ singing the first line of Touch Me <em>a cappella.</em> During the last chorus of Contact, Trey sang lines like âL.A. Womanâ and âMake my funk the P. Funkâ in place of his usual harmonies.</p>\r\n",

    "setlist_notes": "The brief conclusions of Wilson and Tube completed the versions from the previous evening. Weekapaug included Jungle Boogie lyrics and a Divided Sky tease; Weekapaug, YEM, First Tube, and Chalk Dust also included Auld Lang Syne teases. Seven Below was unfinished. The house music played over the P.A. during the second setbreak consisted solely of songs that referenced &ldquo;cars&rdquo; in their titles. As midnight neared during Jungle Boogie (a Phish debut), Fish&rsquo;s drum kit was wheeled to the side of the stage. An Austin Cooper Mini automobile was lowered to the stage from above. The Miami Palmetto Senior High Band and cheerleading squad emerged from the car one-by-one, giving the impression that they were all in the car together. In reality, the car had touched down over a trap door in the stage and the guests came out from underneath. Also emerging were dancers similar to the bunny-women present at the IT Festival. The marching band joined in on the jam that emerged from Jungle Boogie. With the stage covered with marching band members and dancers (some even on top of Page&rsquo;s baby grand piano), an emcee (dressed in an Eddie George, Tennessee Titans, #27 football jersey) counted the clock down to midnight. A massive balloon drop followed. Phish then led the marching band through an instrumental version of Iron Man (also a Phish debut). Reba did not have the whistling ending. For his &ldquo;first song of 2004,&rdquo; in honor of the Miami Heat, Fish&nbsp;performed the Phish debut of Feel the Heat, which contained Fame quotes from Trey and Fish.&nbsp;HYHU contained more references to &ldquo;Henrietta&rsquo;s Heat&rdquo; as Fish&nbsp;took laps around the stage. Frankenstein was preceded by a Fluffhead tease.",
