Trey then said he had a trivia question for the crowd and asked &quot;how many songs end like this?&quot; and the band sang the ending of Brother again. He answered the question by saying the songs were My Friend, My Friend, Rift, and Brother (all of which had their endings &quot;sung&quot;). Trey added that tonight was special because from now on, Timber would also end with the Brother ending (which was sung again). Trey said Page could also end Lawn Boy that way from now on, prompting a Lawn Boy quote from Page. Mike then teased Ha Ha Ha. Trey went on to say that Metallica would be playing at Bader Field soon after Phish and that he didn&#39;t think they ended a single song like the ending of Brother (Trey sang the ending). Trey said if everyone wrote Metallica a note saying &quot;Dear Metallica, please end Master of Puppets like this&quot; (singing the ending one final time), if they got 20,000 notes, they just might do it. Fluffhead and Down With Disease subsequently had endings similar to Brother mixed in with their normal finishes. Reba did not contain the whistling ending.",

    "setlist_notes": "Carl Gerhard sat in on trumpet for Party Time. Trey introduced Gerhard as having come to the School of Phish in 1991 and talked about Gerhard's teaching career in the Armed Services. Trey acknowledged the crowd's request by playing Tube. During I Didn't Know, Trey said that they took FishÂ on the road in 1983 and he went to the Phish School of Music, adding that he was now the executive officer of the \"Air Force.\" Trey said he didn't think FishÂ should be representing the vacuum cleaners without tucking in his shirt (a.k.a. his dress) and asked him to do so (FishÂ complied). Antelope included alternate lyrics \"Been you to tuck in your dress, man?\" \"Tuck, tuck, tuck, tuck\" andÂ \"Tuck in your dress man, you're out of control!\" Trey also said that for 30 years, Fish has been leaving his dress untucked and told everybody to tuck in their dresses. Mike, Trey, and Page tucked in their shirts before the setbreak bow. Split Open and Melt included the alternate lyrics \"Split open and tuck.\" Backwards Down the Number Line contained a DEG tease from Trey. Lengthwise included an invitation for audience members to appear on stage and tuck (a few fans came on stage), contained alternate lyrics \"When you're there, I sleep tuckwise, and when you're tucked, I sleep, you really have to tuck\" and \"I sleep diagonal in my tuck,\" and Trey wielding a light saber, saying \"the force is weak with that one. And that one too. But the force is strong with that one.\" Â The audience was subsequently called out by Fish, Trey, and Page, in part being told repeatedly \"You suck at tucking\" over the Maze intro. The Maze intro also featured Trey asking Chris Kuroda to turn off the lights while he waved the light saber around, talked like Darth Vader, saying \"I am your father, Fish. I am your father,\" and played the guitar with his light saber. Fire contained more Tuck references, with Trey saying \"Tuck it!\" and the alternate lyrics \"Let the Tucker take over!\"Â Mike and Trey sported sombreros for Mexican Cousin.",

Trey later said that Buffalo Bill was one of his all time personal favorites that starts with the drums. After Buffalo Bill, Trey said Fish was a master of songs that he starts himself. Â In the Bowie intro, Trey told the crowd that this was Chris Kuroda's favorite Phish song (having Kuroda give a thumbs up to confirm), adding that \"every day back stage, before we walk on, we say 'Chris? What should we play tonight?' and he only says one song. Every night.\" DWD was unfinished.

After Alumni, Trey said that Fish did have a degree, adding that they met in 1983 at UVM and that Fish held a very interesting record: the lowest grade point average ever recorded at UVM. Fish added &quot;for a non-fraternity student&quot; and both Trey and Fish joked about Fish&#39;s GPA (giving low numbers). Trey added that they were both saved by Page at Goddard and that Page earned $100 for recruiting them to Goddard. Trey introduced Tube and My Sweet One as Fish&nbsp;songs, asking the crowd to count the number of times &quot;you&quot; appeared in the song. There was a delay in starting My Sweet One until Page said they had a lot of interesting stories (about Fish), prompting Fish&nbsp;to immediately start the song. Mike&#39;s and Suzy contained Crosseyed teases from Trey. Tweezer contained a Cars Trucks Buses tease from Mike. BBFCFM included Trey singing into his microphone that he raised above his head, playing his guitar behind his head and running around the stage and Mike playing his bass on his knees.",

    "setlist_notes": "This show featured the floor and stage covered with artificial turf (numerous plants also dotted the stage). Prior to the show, actors played garden sports including croquet, badminton, and mini-golf, while a few more &quot;sunbathed&quot; on a riser behind the stage. During the first setbreak, golfers came on stage and hit soft golf balls into the crowd. &nbsp;Light contained an Auld Lang Syne tease. &nbsp;You Enjoy Myself contained a Birds of a Feather tease. &nbsp;Trey, Page and Mike came out for the third set in golf carts and began hitting golf balls into the crowd. Fish&nbsp;then arrived on a golf cart wearing donut pants and shirt, an argyle vest, and a golf hat. &nbsp;Golf carts were brought back on stage during Kung, then began racing past the stage periodically during Chalk Dust. During the Chalk Dust jam, golfers began getting out of the carts, hitting balls into the crowd and dancing on stage. &nbsp;One of the golfers did the New Year&#39;s countdown from on top of a cart. &nbsp;Auld Lang Syne was accompanied by balloons dropping from the ceiling and ping pong balls fired from cannons. &nbsp;Tweezer Reprise featured Carrie Manolakos on vocals and a number of backup singers. The remainder of the third set and encore featured song titles focusing on a golf theme. Wilson was preceded by an animated Wilson golf ball on the venue&#39;s jumbotrons. Iron Man was preceded by Page coming to the front of the stage to wish the crowd Happy New Year and reference the start of the 30th year of Phish. In an apparent reference to Bob Hope, Page wore a blazer, USS Nimitz ball cap and carried a golf club. Driver was stopped and restarted.This show featured the Phish debuts of Garden Party and Fly Like an Eagle, the first full Phish performance of Iron Man (which was last played December 31, 2003, or 192 shows), and the first ever <em>a cappella</em> Lawn Boy.",
