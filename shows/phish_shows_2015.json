KDF was unfinished. The third set began with the band on a second stage beneath a funnel-shaped screen suspended from the ceiling. As the band jammed, part of the screen descended and became an hourglass shape surrounding the stage, on which a series ofÂ images were projected.Â As the jam continued and the countdown to midnight approached, the band returned to the main stage.",
