Jennifer Hartswick assisted on vocals during Girls, a Jay-Z cover that made its Phish debut. Secret Smile featured a new arrangement.&nbsp; This was the first Sneakin&#39; Sally to contain a vocal jam since May 28, 1989 (1,150&nbsp;shows). The vocal jam led into a brief quote of Coconut.&nbsp; Trey then asked Fish&nbsp;if he was wearing his &ldquo;new suit,&rdquo; referring to his&nbsp;sonic dress. After Fish&nbsp;answered &ldquo;no,&rdquo; Trey went on to rap about how people would have to attend the following night to see Fish&nbsp;play it. The rap slid into a bit of free-form vocal jamming to close the show.",

Unfortunately, no one knew all of the words to Tears of a Clown, so they picked a member of the audience to come onstage and sing (prompting Trey to note, &ldquo;She saved our ass.&rdquo;). Tweezer contained a HYHU jam at the end (with Trey still on guitar and Fish on drums). During HYHU, Fish introduced himself as &ldquo;Prince&rdquo; and added some vacuum accompaniment. Before Terrapin, Trey joked, &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t be needing this anymore!&rdquo; and acted as if he was going to throw his guitar into the crowd, to a reception of lusty boos from the crowd. After Terrapin, Trey took an impromptu poll of the audience as to whether a Fishman tune makes the show or destroys the show, with Page notably coming in on the side of destroys the show, though softening the blow by explaining, &quot;Well, it&#39;s a crapshoot. Sometimes it&#39;s great, but sometimes... you wonder.&quot; Mike, more charitably, stated, &ldquo;On a scale of two to three, I give it a three.&rdquo; Before the Drums Jam with Trey and Fish, Trey noted that it had always been a dream of his to start a song with a double drum solo; this was the first known instance.",

Trey explained that Bowie was an attempt to see âhow far can you push it in the harmonic and rhythmic language and still have people dancing.â During Hood, Trey (speaking in rhythm) noted that because there were a row of rocks separating the band from the crowd, they were feeling a certain level of disconnect (particularlyÂ when Mike plays a \"sexy\" note). To remedy the situation, Trey and Mike ventured down onto the rocks for the duration of the song. At the end of Hood, the band stopped playing, allowing the audience to sing the âYou can feel good, good, good about Hoodâ refrain.",

    "setlist_notes": "This was the second show of the Coventry festival and was the presumed âFinal Show.âÂ When Trey made his âbreak-upâ announcement the preceding May, he indicated that Coventry would be the final Phish shows. In reality, this turned out to be the final public show for over four and a half years. This show was simulcast in movie theaters nationwide. Before Anything But Me, Trey announced that, for the first time in 21 years, he was nervous performing a Phish show. During Wolfmanâs, Trey revealed that the Wolfmanâs Brother is, in fact, Fish (as well as the fact that he handed the phone to his friend Liz Durfee). Also, during Wolfmanâs, Trey and Mike invited their mothers onstage (and later John Paluska) to do the âsexy bumpâ dance. Disease was unfinished and featured Trey briefly playing his guitar with a glow stick. Both Page and Trey broke down during an especially emotional Velvet Sea. After a thoroughly botched Glide, all four band members offered words of thanks to the fans for their continued support and dedication and brief reflections on their twenty years together. Trey then stated that what they really needed to do was âblow off some fucking steamâ before starting up Melt. There was an enormous glow stick war during Ghost featuring hundreds, if not thousands, of orange glow sticks. This version of Seven Below saw all of the band members sporadically shouting âSeven Belowâ throughout the jam. The Phish debut of Cool Jerk contained alternate lyrics honoring monitor mixer, Mark âBrunoâ Bradley. The Dickie Scotland Song was spontaneously created and included lyrics in honor of production manager, Hadden Hipsley, and tour accountant, Richard Glasgow (a.k.a. Dickie Scotland). Before Wilson, Trey asked the crowd to sing to another of their friends âfor the last time.â There was a fireworks display between the end of the third set and the encore. Before the encore, while explaining the origins of The Curtain, Trey jokingly announced that the entire Chicago Symphony and the Twyla Tharp Dance Troupe were going to perform Gamehendge. Trey explained that they chose The Curtain With as the last song to bring them full circle, because, not only was it one of the first Phish songs he wrote, but he wrote it in a cabin one town over from Coventry. Trey stopped and restarted the jam segment of the Curtain With, because they were in the wrong key or, as he explained, âSince we are going to be bringing ourselves back in time, we may as well do it in the correct key.â There was no P.A. music after the Curtain With.",
