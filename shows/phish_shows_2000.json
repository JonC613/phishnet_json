Funky Bitch and My Soul were performed as a warm-up before the show went on the air, although the crowd was already in the bar. Jibboo through Heavy Things were aired live on the show (except for Magilla, which was played during a commercial break). Magilla was played for the first time since August 1, 1998 (109 shows). The band briefly jammed on the <em>Jeopardy!</em> theme (with the crowd providing some vocals) during a radio break, although this is not included on any circulating recordings.Â Bug included a brief DEG tease. There was a humorous question and answer session between the band and audience during one of the commercial breaks. Studio versions of Birds, Bouncing, and Heavy Things were used as intros and outros for the commercials.",

At the end of the encore, Trey joked that, if anyone missed anything, they should read the book or see the movie. Trey also teased Moby Dick at the end of the encore's Chalk Dust Reprise. Prior to this show, Moby Dick had not been played since November 29, 1997 (174 shows).",

The Mockingbird narration referenced the bandâs upcoming hiatus. I Didnât Know included a reference to Kid Rockâs sidekick Joe C. Esther featured flubbed lyrics for the final verse, ending with Trey proclaiming: âShe died. Dead.â As the band returned for the second set, the crowd serenaded Trey with Happy Birthday. Twist contained San-Ho-Zay teases from Trey. Emotional Rescue included a bizarre synchronized duel on-stage between Trey and Mike. This show was webcast live and subsequently released in its entirety as the bandâs first full concert DVD, <em>Live in Vegas</em>.",
