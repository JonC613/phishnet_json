In Antelope, &quot;Marco Esquandolas&quot; was changed to &quot;Mike-O Esquandolas,&quot; followed by a Mike solo. The end of Wilson contained a Dixie tease from Trey. In place of a traditional Makisupa keyword, Trey improvised verses that set up solos for Mike, then Fish, then Page. The subsequent Piper intro included repeated phrases from the Makisupa (&quot;Policeman,&quot; &quot;House,&quot; and &quot;Listen to Mike&quot;).&nbsp;Trey quoted Whole Lotta Love in the vocal jam of YEM.

Squirming Coil contained The Rain Song and Thank You teases from Page and Possum also contained a Sneakin' Sally tease. The incomplete versions of Heartbreaker, Thank You, and Stairway to Heaven were all Phish debuts. Ramble On was played for the first time since August 12, 1998 (307 shows). After Stairway to Heaven, Trey joked, \"Happy Halloween! See you all next year.\" Mike teased The Lemon Song before Halley's. Appropriately, Whole Lotta Love was also the post-show music. From the soundcheck, Ramble On and the second and third versions of Whole Lotta Love were incomplete. Destiny Unbound was played by only Mike and Fish, started out as being sung to the drumbeat of Time Loves A Hero and included a Live and Let Die quote from Mike.",

    "setlist_notes": "Page performed Frankenstein on keytar. Ghost included a San-Ho-Zay tease from Trey. Spooky was performed for the first time since April 14, 1993 (754 shows). The second set \"musical costume\" was Little Feat'sÂ <em>Waiting for Columbus</em>. Join the Band (the first track ofÂ <em>Waiting for Columbus</em>)<em>Â </em>was played over the P.A. before the start of the second set. Subsequently, Phish was introduced by Kevin Statesir (founder of Higher Ground) as \"Little Feat\" before Fat Man in the Bathtub. In the tradition of some of Phish's previous crowd experiments in the early '90s, flyers explaining a new Secret Language prank were included in the Phishbills that were passed out to fans as they walked into the show. The prank, designed to confuse those who would later listen to the recording, consisted of an announcer introducing Phish (as Little Feat). When the announcer would say a letter of the band FEAT (\"Give me an F!\"), the crowd would respond with letters corresponding to PHISH (\"P-H!\"). All of the songs in the second set other than Time Loves a Hero were Phish debuts. All of the songs in the second set, other than Don't Bogart That Joint and Willin', featured Giovanni Hidalgo on percussion. A five piece horn section consisting of Aaron Johnson on trombone, Stuart Bogie on saxophone, Ian Hendrickson-Smith on saxophone, Michael Leonhart on trumpet, and Eric Biondo on trumpet joined the band for Old Folks Boogie, Time Loves a Hero, Day or Night, Mercenary Territory, Spanish Moon, Dixie Chicken, Rocket in My Pocket and Feats Don't Fail Me Now. Willin' featured Page on bass, Mike on piano, Trey on drums and Fish on vocals. Prior to the piano solo at the beginning of Willin', Fish remarked, \"That's supposed to be Bill Payne on the keyboard.\" Don't Bogart That Joint was performed <em>a cappella</em>. Trey introduced the guest musicians at the start of Feats Don't Fail Me Now and Page teased \"Charge!\" during the introductions. At the conclusion of the second set, the entire band marched the perimeter of the floor. Disease was unfinished, was initially botched, and had to be restarted, prompting Fish to declare, \"This one's off <em>our </em>album.\" Julius featured Giovanni Hidalgo and the <em>Waiting for Columbus</em>Â horn section.",

Manteca was played for the first time since October 30, 1998 (303 shows) and the ensuing YEM vocal jam contained Manteca quotes. Before midnight, several groups of multiethnic dancers appeared on stage and sang the Meatstick lyrics in their respective languages. The band joined the dancers and thenÂ stealthily disappeared from the stage, only to reappear at the other side of the arena in the giant hotdog from past NYE shows ('94 and '99). As a result, portions of the Meatstick were pre-recorded. Auld Lang Syne was sung with the Meatstick singers while Trey playedÂ guitar.Â Appropriately, the post-show music was Captain Beefheart's <a href=\"http://phish.net/song/tropical-hot-dog-night/history\">Tropical Hot Dog Night</a>.",
