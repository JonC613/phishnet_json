		"setlist_notes": "<p>Trey teased I Can't Turn You Loose in Divided Sky. The Horse featured Trey on acoustic guitar. This long version of Wilson included a Simpsons signal and, towards the end, a freakish jam that included an Iron Man tease from Mike. Reba included a tease of the theme from <em>Woody Woodpecker</em>. The first Tweezer had Straight Out the Sewer quotes from Trey and aÂ Low Rider jam. Glide subsequently included Tweezer teases. Mikeâs Song featured minor lyric changes, three different Tweezer teases, two different Wilson teases, and other teases of Reba, Lizards, and Stash. During Hydrogen before the Vibration of Life, Mike teased Entrance of the Gladiators. After Kung, Mike quoted NO2. The Rock and Roll All Nite jam was for fan Jay von Lehe, dressed as Kissâs Gene Simmons, who the band brought on stage to sing the songâs chorus. Terrapin featured band intros and lots of chatter from Fish, prompting a hurry-up HYHU tease from Page. Fish also performed a lengthy vacuum solo during this tune. The HYHU outro segued into Hood as Fish and Trey switched places. Neither Have Mercy (first since Halloween, 1986, or 680Â shows) nor MMGAMOIO were played in their entirety. Walk Away was played for the first time since November 2, 1991 (159 shows).Â This show was released as part of theÂ <em>Phish At The Roxy</em>Â box set.</p>\r\n",

After Big Ball Jam, the crew set up a folding chair, Trey&rsquo;s acoustic guitar, and an extra microphone on stage. Trey introduced &quot;Neil Young&quot; to the roaring crowd, then went behind the drums and began playing the Hold Your Head Up intro with Fish appearing&nbsp;instead. Some friends sitting in the front row promptly hit Fish in the face with a pie. Fish sang&nbsp;a line of After the Gold Rush (with Page assisting on piano) before launching into Terrapin. After the second Hold Your Head Up, Trey joked that Bill Clinton would be helping out on saxophone for the next song prompting Page and Fish to tease Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1.
