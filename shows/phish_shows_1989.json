    "setlist_notes": "This was the band&rsquo;s first major gig in Boston. The Paradise held around 650 people, they didn&rsquo;t think the band could come close to selling out the room and so refused to book Phish. John Paluska and Ben Hunter, who were managing Phish at the time, therefore rented the room for the evening. John and Ben promoted the gig heavily, including via radio. Tickets were only $5. Tom Baggott, a fan of the band, helped get Burlington fans to the show by Greyhound bus. Not only did the gig sell out, but there were some 200 people shut out (mostly Boston University and Boston College students). I Didn&#39;t Know featured Fish&nbsp;on trombone. Alumni contained additional lyrics. Prior to YEM, Trey welcomed his mom, who had come &quot;all the way from Ireland.&quot; After YEM, Trey said that they had a special guest that night for the person in the front row that kept requesting that they play Minkin. Trey mentioned that there was a Minkin hanging behind the band and that Minkin was also there that night. There was a subsequent brief Minkin vocal tease prior to Lizards. This version of Sanity was the fast version.",

One recording in circulation contains the first set, as listed above. Another contains the above list for sets II (incomplete) and III. Since songs are repeated within the list, it is likely that one is mislabeled. This was the last Phish show at Nectar&rsquo;s and the master copy of sets II and III is specifically labeled as such; the recording circulating as the first set may be from the night before or from another show entirely. Also, the band wished the audience good night after Harpua and made several references to it being the &ldquo;last song&rdquo; so this is likely a final set from another show where Foam may have been the encore. Since an exact date cannot be ascertained, we will continue to list as is.",

A fire alarm sounded as Fluffhead moved into the Clod segment of Fluffâs Travels, which caused the building to be evacuated. When the band retook the stage, they started up a humorous pass at You Shook Me All Night Long and then dove back into Fluffâs Travels. Fire was dedicated to the âbrave menâ who turned off the fire alarm. Suzy contained Sailor's HornpipeÂ teases from Trey. Trey and Page teased Blue Monk in Possum. Bowie included a brief Frosty the Snowman jam in the intro, as well as a Riders on the Storm tease from Page and a Santa Claus is Coming to Town tease. Melt contained a FishÂ drum solo. Love You was played for the first time since October 31, 1987 (138Â shows) and featured FishÂ on trombone. Harpua contained \"Charge!\" and Price of Love teases from Page, multiple Gimme Some Lovin' teases, and a Walk This Way tease from Mike.",

This show featured the first known Phish performance of Funky (Breakdown). Funky (Breakdown) and Price of Love featured guest appearances by Ninja Mike (vocals) and Magoo (guitar). Fish&nbsp;intermittently played trombone and vacuum during the latter. Melt featured a Fish&nbsp;drum solo. The vocal jam at the end of Sneakin&#39; Sally included Changes (David Bowie) and My Sharona (The Knack) quotes. Ya Mar&#39;s lyrics included references to wild pigs and Paul.",

    "setlist_notes": "This show was at the wedding reception of Beth and Steven Drebber (the latter of The Joneses fame). Blue Sky was dedicated to the newlyweds. During Suzy, Mike teased Sunshine of Your Love, Trey teased Sailor's Hornpipe, andÂ some of the attendees got on the trampolines. On Your Way Down was preceded by La Grange teases. Blue Monk was played for the first time since February 21, 1987 (204 shows).Â I Didn't Know featured FishÂ on trombone. Icculus included Steven Drebber on vocals and an unknown trumpet player (possibly Fish). Antelope featured Steven on drums and FishÂ on trumpet and trombone.Â  This show included the first known performance of The Oh Kee Pa Ceremony, the first known public Phish performances of On Green Dolphin Street, Autumn Leaves, and My Favorite Things, and the first known Phish performances of In a Mellow Tone, Four, Lucky Seven, Blue Sky and Night and Day.",

The band distributed boxes of macaroni and cheese for audience use during the Bowie intro. This Bowie, at over 20 minutes, was, at the time, one of the longest versions ever. During the pause in Letter to Jimmy Page, Trey wished happy birthday to \"Mary Ellen.\" Lizards contained an <em>I Dream of Jeannie</em> themeÂ tease from Page. The show closed with Trey returning to the Kung theme, as he promised to stage another runaway golf cart marathon this time next year. Ninja Custodian was the opening act.",

Adding to the confusion was an explosion on or near the stage during David Bowie (possibly a flash pot or fireworks) which pushed the crowd over the edge. The show was cut short when the house lights were turned on and bouncers quickly evacuated everybody from the venue. The source of these show notes is phish.com.",

Trey asked the crowd to yell &quot;All right Chris!&quot; when Popper came out on stage. After Jesus Just Left Chicago, Popper said &quot;I better get back to those lights.&quot; Trey teased DEG in Mike&#39;s Song and Dixie in Ya Mar. Lizards was teased before Antelope.

Four unknown jazz standards were also performed. Page's dad, Jack McConnell, sat in with the band on vocals for All Of MeÂ and Basin Street Blues. Fish played a trombone solo during I Didn't Know. Page's parents, the band members' siblings, Andrew Fischbeck, and others were in attendance. Between sets, Trey explained his thesis \"The Man Who Stepped into Yesterday\", commonly known as âGamehendgeâ (without any musical accompaniment), to the McConnells and others while sitting around talking.
