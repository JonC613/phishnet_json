Fish took a boring &quot;drum solo,&quot; which drew whistles from the crowd. Piper contained a Lady (Little River Band) tease from Page and Trey and Possum contained a Stash tease from Trey.

The 11:00 a.m. announcement was that tickets would be sold at noon the vacant Pier 32, prompting a mad rush of fans to the waterfront. Of the several thousand who arrived, roughly four hundred lucky people were able to buy vouchers entitling them to a pair of tickets. Prior to Brian and Robert, Trey said that Fish used to hate the yellow light and that Fish used to have a list of things that he hated, adding that every time they found out something Fish hated, they'd always do it (prompting Page to tease HYHU, which Fish also hates). Fish added that he hated the vowel \"ooo\" (the crowd responded with \"ooo\" noises). Trey said the only way to overcome something you hate was to face it head on. Trey then had Chris Kuroda shine a yellow light on Fish for Brian and Robert.Â Reba did not have the whistling ending. Hood contained a tease of Aaron Coplandâs Fanfare for the Common Man. After the show, some fans were given a poster (later for sale from Phish Dry Goods) and a bumper sticker (saying: âWeâve just come from Phish at the Fillmore. It was nice.â).",

Driver and Bittersweet Motel featured Trey on acoustic guitar. Bittersweet Motel also contained a Free Bird-style ending.Â Moma Dance included Monkey Man (Rolling Stones) teases. The Harpua narration picked up where the December 6, 1996 Harpua ended; Jimmy hitched a ride from Vegas to Salt Lake City and the driver was playing <em>Dark Side of the Moon</em>. <em>Dark Side</em> was reportedly chosen the day of the show, partially based on sluggish ticket sales for this one venue compared to the rest of the tour. All the <em>Dark Side </em>songs were Phish debuts except for Great Gig (last played July 5, 1994, or 333 shows), although the original album version of Speak to Me was piped through the P.A. on Halloween, 1994 and Breathe was jammed on October 25, 1995. Smells Like Teen Spirit was also a Phish debut.",

For this show, the Holiday Run dancersâ costumes included a devil, a prostitute, and a pimp. The band jammed Runaway Jim until just before the New Year. The dancers reappeared throughout the crowd and handed out thousands of glowrings to the fans just before a grand balloon drop and pyrotechnics display at midnight. The band counted the crowd into the New Year before busting into Auld Lang Syne.Â While some fans used the glowrings to start a Glowstick War during Hood, others used them to create long chain links of rings spanning the venue from end to end.",
