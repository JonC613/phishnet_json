The shirts were again referenced during Icculus, with the image showing on the video screens and Trey saying it was written by the man on the screen. The Rock and Roll jam featured a tease from Mike of A Love Supreme. Reba did not contain the whistling ending. Bike was played for the first time since June 18, 2009 (100 shows). During his vacuum solo, Fish teased Over the Rainbow. After his solo, Fish forgot the words to Bike, prompting the band to play HYHU.

    "setlist_notes": "This show was the third of the three-show Super Ball IX festival. The Curtain was played for the first time since September 9, 2000 (202 shows). The first Mockingbird narration since September 30, 2000 (188 shows) referenced the previous night's fourth set <a href=\"http://phish.net/song/storage-jam/history/?artist=1\">Storage Jam</a>Â and explained that all of SBIX was merely a mental projection of a reality that the band created in 1988 on their way to Colorado. Mike teased the theme from <em>The Twilight Zone</em> and the theme from <em>Leave it to Beaver</em> during BBFCFM, Wilson contained a Mind Left Body tease, and Reba contained Dave's Energy Guide teases. A Song I Heard the Ocean Sing and Disease were unfinished. The setbreak featured All-American themed music. This show featured the Phish debut of Big Balls.Â Before the encore, Trey thanked each of the crew, management and artists who helped make Super Ball IX happen. First Tube was accompanied by and followed by fireworks.",

Prior to Steam, a steam kettle and hot plate went off on stage, with Trey acting like he was attempting to put out the steam. Shortly after the song began, steam also came from the floor near the soundboard area. An amp (with the steam kettle on it), a keytar, a bass, a vacuum, and a few lights were then lifted off the stage. A woman in the front of the stage tossed a &ldquo;Steam&rdquo; sign into the front row, then rose with a barricade and security guard before eventually being lifted up over the band. Several other aerialists (clothed in various casual attire, equipped with black backpacks emitting smoke and lights on their backs) subsequently rose up from the crowd and ascended and descended several times. The first aerialist counted down to midnight, at which point balloons were released from the ceiling. The aerialists later returned with lights in their hands for Down with Disease, which also featured Trey and Mike being raised up and back down a few times before finally rising several feet on hydraulic lifts. Steam contained a Spooky tease from Trey and Disease was unfinished.",
