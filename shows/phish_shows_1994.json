I Wan&#39;na Be Like You also made its Phish debut. The show kicked off with an <em>a cappella</em> line of Back In My Hometown. Reba contained A-Hunting We Will Go teases from Trey and Mike and It&#39;s Ice contained Hey Bulldog (Beatles) teases. Buried Alive through I Wan&#39;na Be Like You and Suzy Greenberg featured The Giant Country Horns: Mike Gallick on baritone sax, Carl &ldquo;Geerz&rdquo; Gerhard on trumpet, Dave &ldquo;The Truth&rdquo; Grippo on alto sax, Don Glasgo on trombone, Chris Peterman on tenor sax, and Joey Sommerville on trumpet. Magilla was played slightly differently than most versions, with more of a shuffle beat. Wolfman&#39;s contained an Alumni Blues jam. Suzy contained Horn introductions and a HYHU tease from Page. Before and after Hood, Trey updated the crowd on the score of the Duke - Arkansas NCAA championship basketball game. Cavern, which contained the old, alternate lyrics, featured Gerhard on trumpet.",

Divided Sky contained a brief Auld Lang Syne tease from Trey. Weekapaug contained a Can't You Hear Me Knocking tease as well as an Auld Lang Syne tease from Trey. Slave contained Crimes of the Mind teases. Before the lights went out for the third set, the audience âoverheardâ the band before the set. Fish wound up saying âI want a jumbo hot dog, large fries and shakeâ delivered on stage. The band came out, started up My Sweet One, and was interrupted by an announcer asking who ordered the food. The band pointed at Fish, who looked confused as huge props of a hot dog, fries and shakes descended from the ceiling next to the drum set. The band played 2001 while the hot dog landed. The James Bond Theme was then broadcast over the PA while technicians (wearing âRocket Scientistâ jackets) prepared the hot dog, and the band climbed in with their instruments and flew out over the audience, as balloons popped and feathers, confetti and âPhish NYE 1994â ping pong balls fell from the ceiling. Various music, including the Captain Beefheart song Tropical Hot Dog Night, was played over the P.A. as the hot dog space ship flew back and forth. Mike's maternal grandmother, Lillian Cherry, joined the band on stage for Chalk Dust with a shoe in her hand.Â This version of Bouncing appears on <em>A Live One</em>.",

Jimmy decided to put on his favorite album <em>Barney's Greatest Hits, </em>but turned his turntable on the wrong way and started playing it backwards. FishÂ then proceeded to sing a verse of War Pigs (with the band playing the song as well. Trey subsequently quoted I Love You (a.k.a. the theme to <em>Barney & Friends</em>) before Harpua resumed. Poster was swallowed up into the earth by the Vibration of Death. \"The Vibration of Death is gone\" replaced the usual \"The storm is gone.\" Prior to the Vibration of Life, Wilson was teased and quoted and Page teased Call to the Post. A Pink Floyd <em>Dark Side of the Moon</em> tease (the heartbeats from Speak to Me) was pumped through the P.A. at the beginning of the second set. The second set \"musical costume\" was The Beatles' <em>The Beatles </em>(also known as <em>The White Album</em>) and was selected via fan vote<em>. </em>All of the <em>White Album</em> songs, other than Piggies, were Phish debuts, although Ob La Di, Ob La Da had been jammed or teased on many occasions. Glass Onion's lyrics were changed to \"I told you 'bout Guyute the pig.\"Â Piggies was played for the first time since November 14, 1985Â (884Â shows). HYHU was teased prior to Why Don't We Do It in the Road. Birthday wasnât sung; Page and Mike noodled a bit while FishÂ presented a birthday cake to Brad Sands, who accepted it while wearing a Jon Fishman dress. Helter Skelter ended with the band singing \"I've got blisters on my fingers\" <em>a cappella</em> to the tune of Back In My Hometown. Honey Pie's lyrics were changed to reference \"Cactus.\" Cry Baby Cry ended with FishÂ on vacuum with Revolution 9 segueing out of the vacuum solo. The background tape playing along with Revolution 9 was Mikeâs composition He Ent to the Bog from Phishâs <em>White Tape</em>. The song ended with FishÂ stark naked and running around while the band blew bubbles and waved. Good Night was taped from the album and closed the second set. The third set began with a Custard Pie tease from Trey and an Overture tease from Page, while Bowie contained a <em>Gilligan's Island</em> theme tease from Mike and Antelope's intro contained a Stash tease from Trey. The Costume Contest contained a \"Charge!\" tease from Page. This show was officially released as <em>Live Phish 13</em>.
