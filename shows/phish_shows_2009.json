    "setlist_notes": "This show featured the first versions of Forbinâs and Mockingbird since September 30, 2000 (96 shows), which were performed without narration. During I Didnât Know, Trey introduced Fish as âRecent Julliard Masterâs Vacuum Program graduate, the one and only, Jon Moses Quagmire DeWitt Hampton.â DWD was unfinished. Piper included a Spill the Wine tease from Page. This show featured the first Psycho Killer since December 7, 1997 (284 shows). Psycho Killer was unfinished and disintegrated into a self-described, electronic âPongâ jam. During the post-Psycho Killer âPongâ jam, Trey initiated a dance contest saying that whoever could best dance to that music would âwin something.âÂ  After Catapult (while continuing the âPongâ jam), Trey asked, âDoes everybody else love this song as much as I do?â and said that he was âwaiting for the day when they play stuff like this on the radio.âÂ  Icculus was last performed on July 18, 1999 (195 shows). The Icculus narration centered on the fact that âyou crazy kidsâ just donât read anymore.Â  The âPongâ jam reappeared during the YEM jam. The soundcheck included a jam with lyrics that were made up on the fly with Trey on bass (so that Mike could check on bass sounds from the audience) and Fish on drums. Trey briefly quoted Spill the Wine and The Pendulum during the soundcheck jam.",

I only apologize to [the audience].&rdquo; Prior to the encore, Trey stated that it was hard to play the last show of the tour because they felt like they could just keep going.&nbsp; Before starting the debut performance of I Been Around, Trey explained that they were playing it because he realized that it was the one song off of the upcoming album (<em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Joy</em>) that they hadn&rsquo;t played live.",

During Bouncing, some of the balloons were dripped into the crowd. This show featured the Phish debut of Backwards Down the Number Line.

Disease was also unfinished. This show marked the Phish debuts of Undermind and She Thinks I Still Care. Frankenstein featured Page on keytar. Mike and Fish teased Seven Below in Twist. Before Contact, the band and audience sang Happy Birthday (last performed on July 25, 1999, or 165 shows) to Fishâs Dad, Leonard, and the end of Contact featured a Happy Birthday jam. During Tweezer Reprise, balloons were dropped into the crowd. The post-show music included \"Sweet Virginia\" from <a href=\"http://phish.net/setlists/?d=2009-10-31\"><em>Exile on Main Street</em></a><em>.</em>",

After Grind, Trey remarked that Page blew the wrong note on the pitch pipe and had them all singing in the wrong key. They decided to perform another <em>a cappella</em> song and Trey joked that if they couldn&rsquo;t get it right, Fish would sing Bike. Sure enough, Hello My Baby was no better and was aborted. However, true to his word, Trey announced that Fish will now sing Bike. For his part, Fish took the opportunity to welcome everyone to &ldquo;the trainwreck portion of the show.&rdquo; Bike was played for the first time since September 12, 2000 (95 shows).",

Trey said that Les was a hero to all of the band members for, among other reasons, continuing playing music into his nineties and that hopefully they would be playing into their nineties too. Finally, Trey dedicated the ensuing version of How High the Moon (last played on March 8, 1993 (714 shows)), to the memory of Les.Â  Trey changed the lyrics of Antelope to âBeen you to have any splash cymbal solo, man?â, after which Fish took a splash cymbal solo.",

    "setlist_notes": "This show was part of the three-show <a href=\"http://www.phish.com/festival8\">Festival 8</a>. Playbills were distributed on-site (beginning at 12:30 p.m., 8 hours in advance) confirming that the second set (the band's \"musical costume\") would be the Rolling Stones' <em>Exile on Main St</em>. After Divided Sky, Trey acknowledged the beauty of theÂ venueÂ and announced that Page would now play a love song to the lawn since it was the first time they had played on grassÂ in a long time.Â Antelope's lyrics were changed to Â \"Been you to have any Coil, man?\" (The Coil was an art installation on the venue grounds.)Â Set 2 began with a video highlighting selections of the 99 classic albums displayed and then systematically eliminated on the phish.com web site leading up to the festival. Selections in the montage included snippets from Michael Jackson's <em>Thriller</em>, T.Rex's <em>Electric Warrior</em>, Metallica's <em>Master of Puppets</em>, Miles Davis's <em>A Tribute to Jack Johnson</em>, Fleetwood Mac's <em>Rumours</em> and The Doors (self titled), among others. All of the <em>Exile on Main St</em>Â songs were Phish debuts, except for <a href=\"http://phish.net/song/loving-cup\">Loving Cup</a>Â andÂ <a href=\"http://phish.net/song/sweet-virginia\">Sweet Virginia</a>.Â All songs in the second set except for Casino Boogie, Torn and Frayed, and I Just Want To See His Face featured Dave Guy on trumpet, David Smith on trombone, and Tony Jarvis on saxophone. Tumbling Dice, Sweet Virginia, and Loving Cup through Soul Survivor also featured Sharon Jones and Saundra Williams on backup vocals.Â Trey introduced the horn section after Tumbling Dice and again after the completion of the costume, before saying \"We are the Rolling Stones. See you later.\" Suzy Greenberg was played with Jones, Williams, andÂ the horns. This show featured the first Sweet Virginia since September 26, 1999 (175 shows).",

    "setlist_notes": "This show was part of the three-show <a href=\"http://www.phish.com/festival8\">Festival 8</a>. The first set, which started at noon, was billed as Phish&#39;s &quot;first full-length acoustic set&quot; (complete with complimentary coffee and Festival 8 themed donuts). The first set featured Trey and Mike on acoustics, Page solely on piano, and a unique stage setup&nbsp;that had Fish&nbsp;stage right with Page on the far left. Before Brian and Robert, Trey encouraged the crowd to sit down due to the &quot;mellow&quot; nature of the set; he added that they had never before played to a crowd that was sitting. Whether the crowd should stand up or sit down became a running joke throughout the set, until Trey confessed during Wilson that he only asked the crowd to sit down at the request of the crew and, in fact, he hates telling people what to do (and also hates sitting down). This show marked the Phish debuts of Invisible and Sleep Again. Fish&nbsp;performed a whistle solo on My Sweet One. The band briefly left the stage after McGrupp, returning to encore with Driver, Talk, and Secret Smile. The second and third sets were played later that evening.&nbsp;Reba lacked the whistling ending. Trey took a moment before Tweeprise to thank those who helped put on the festival.",

The acoustic soundcheck was not broadcast and the song orderÂ may be incorrect.Â The short Devil With a Blue Dress On Jam included the chorus and part of a verse sung by Trey, as well as a Good Golly Miss Molly quote. The Starship Trooper Jam consisted of part of the WÃ¼rm segment of the song. Before Liquid Time, Trey quoted Fuck Your Face and briefly teased Kids (MGMT); the jam out of Liquid Time dissolved into a vocal jam featuring the band members snoring and featured a Lengthwise quote from Trey.Â ",

    "setlist_notes": "AC/DC Bag and Ghost contained Auld Lang Syne teases. Swept Away and Steep were played for the first time since July 1, 2000 (145 shows). Demand was played for the first time since November 14, 1996 (394 shows). NO2 was played for the first time since July 13, 1999 (221 shows). Prior to the third set, a pedestal stating 2010 was placed on the front of the stage and a covered structure was placed behind Fish's drumset. During DWD, as the clock turned midnight, hundreds of balloons were released upon the crowd, fireworks went off on each side of the stage, and a disco ball was lowered onto the pedestal. After DWD, Trey opened the ball and FishÂ climbed inside. Trey and Mike, with some help from stagehands, proceeded to put the ball in a giant cannon aimed towards a giant net hanging from the rafters with an illuminated âXâ on it. Page hit the trigger and purportedly \"blasted\" the ball through, not only the net, but also the roof of the arena. A searchlight appeared to come through the roof and was accompanied by helicopter sounds. With FishÂ apparently shot out of the venue, Trey asked if anybody knew how to play the drums and ended up finding Sarah, a girl from Pittsburgh. Trey asked how long she had played the drums and what her favorite song was and she responded with six months and Fluffhead respectively. Sarah was surreptitiously replaced by Fish, now wearing a dress identical to Sarah's and a black wig, who played the entire third set and encore, but Sarah came out at the end of the third set and bowed with the band instead of him. Blue Moon was a Phish debut and was performed as an instrumental while Trey thanked the entire crew. After the show, the disco ball was revealed to have \"crashed\" into a white car that had been parked in front of the American Airlines Arena with a sign on the windshield stating \"This car was driven down from Vermont\" and \"fueled by maple syrup.\" Â After being âstruckâ by the âhuman cannonball,â the car was emitting smoke and leaking maple syrup and the entire area was cordoned off with police tape.Â ",
