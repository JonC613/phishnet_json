This show featured the first known Phish performance of Let's Go, which replaced HYHU. After the second Let's Go, Trey introduced the crew (with Page providing \"Charge!\" teases) and dedicated Mike's Song to \"Mindy\" and the \"spirit of Ian in the back of the room.\" Pete Schall's name was spoken in the Mike's intro. Page teased Fishin' Hole (aka <em>The Andy Griffith Show</em> theme) during Hydrogen. Trey quoted and teased Groove is in the Heart in Weekapaug Groove. A recording of Antelope through Rocky Top also circulates as 9/17/90, but it is believed that 2/4/91 is the correct date for this portion of the setlist. Â  Â ",

During a pause in Letter to Jimmy Page, Trey noted: âweâre not going to forget that this got cut short, and the next time weâre back in the area weâre going to make it up to you.â Before the hasty encore Trey remarked: âweâre going to have to watch out for the âbig hook!'â",

Trey briefly started Horn before Harry Hood, but abandoned it. Before Terrapin, Trey announced that Fish&nbsp;would be &ldquo;bringing out the big, heavy artillery&rdquo; for the people in Keene. The &ldquo;artillery&rdquo; was Fish&rsquo;s new vacuum, which made its debut at this show. Fish noted that &ldquo;if I bleed during this song, that&rsquo;ll just be part of the effects.&rdquo; Inspired by his new instrument, Fish took an exceedingly spacey solo during Terrapin, complete with ersatz wolf howls, before singing the final verse <em>through </em>the vacuum.",

Mr. P.C. was performed for the first time since November 11, 1988 (338Â shows) and included a <em>Spider-Man</em> theme tease from Gerhard. The Man Who Stepped Into Yesterday was introduced as âThe Old Man Who Stepped Into Yesterday.â This show fell on Pageâs 28th birthday, a point noted repeatedly throughout the gig. I Didn't Know featured FishÂ on trombone. Fluffhead was unfinished; the rest of the band sung Happy Birthday to Page first over the Fluffhead melody, followed by the Happy Birthday melody. Happy Birthday was performed for the first time since September 29, 1990 (105 shows). Possum contained Yield Not To Temptation and I Know a Little teases. Magilla contained a full-band <em>Flintstones</em> theme tease. Mississippi Queen was teased during Fish's vacuum solo in Bike. The pause in BBFCFM featured a final rendition of Happy Birthday and the presentation of a cake; FishÂ then responded to the âhow old are you?â crowd chants by counting off BBFCFM: âIâll tell you how old he is: 1-2-3-4!â",

The show began with a humorous announcement from Trey that he felt &ldquo;overdressed&rdquo; during National Nudist Week. My Sweet One included a tease of the <em>Bonanza</em> theme and Magilla included a <em>Flintstones</em>&nbsp;theme tease. I Didn&#39;t Know, in which Fish&nbsp;was introduced as &quot;Hank,&quot; and Touch Me featured Fish&nbsp;on trombone. Possum included <em>Charlie Chan</em> and Oom Pa Pa signals as well as a Dave&rsquo;s Energy Guide tease, while Weekapaug included more DEG teases.&nbsp;Trey introduced the Giant Country Horns at the end of Antelope and during BBFCFM. There was a long wait during HYHU for Fish, who was apparently in the bathroom. Hood included full-band <em>Jeopardy!</em> theme teases. This show ran much longer than scheduled (at one point, when Trey noted that they should wind up the show, a fan urged the band to &ldquo;fuck the clock&rdquo;), prompting Trey to beg the crowd to leave in a timely and orderly fashion after the encore.",

Brother was dedicated to &ldquo;the guy who offered us $10,000 to play a different song.&rdquo; In the HYHU intro, Fish&nbsp;said &ldquo;I hate this fucking song,&rdquo; that the only reason the band plays the song is because he hates it and added &ldquo;All I have do in this band is say I hate something, and it&rsquo;ll be done forever.&rdquo; Trey told the crowd that HYHU is the Henrietta theme precisely because Fish hates it. &ldquo;It used to be &lsquo;La Bamba,&rsquo;&rdquo; he noted, prompting Mike to play a bit of La Bamba. The HYHU outro featured Fish on trombone and later telling the crowd &quot;you paid for this, this is what you bought.&quot; Trey said &quot;If you only knew what a nightmare that was for poor Fish, having to listen to that song&quot; and Fish responded with &ldquo;they just do it out of HATE.&rdquo; Trey asked who could tell him who wrote that song, and a fan answered correctly. Trey said the fan won the $10,000 the other guy was going to give them to a play a song and Page said the fan won a date with Fish, with Trey adding &quot;and you can guarantee that he&#39;ll be late.&quot; After Golgi, Trey thanked the crowd, saying &quot;we&#39;ll be right back with more songs that Fish hates, more songs that we love, and more songs that people are willing to pay $10,000 to hear.&quot; Trey introduced Page as Leon before his piano solos in My Sweet One and Rocky Top. Before Fish&#39;s trombone solo in I Didn&#39;t Know, Trey mentioned the last time they played in the area (see 4/11/91), they made Fish get up and tell a joke (The Prison Joke) that was &quot;absolutely the stupidest joke ever&quot; and that he (Trey) wasn&#39;t going tell the punchline. Trey went on to explain that most people around here thought Fish was a pretty bad joke teller and he wanted to give him a chance to redeem himself.&nbsp; Fish&#39;s joke was &quot;Why did the Siamese twins go to England? To let the other one drive for a while.&quot; Page also teased HYHU while Trey talked. Adeline was sung from the balcony without microphones to open the encore. Possum contained two <em>Charlie Chan</em> signals as well as Simpsons and Random Laugh signals in its intro and subsequently contained Rock On (David Essex) teases.",

Bowie subsequently contained another Charlie Chan signal and a Tritone Down signal during the jam and maniacal screaming from Trey and Mike during the end segment. After Bowie, Trey introduced &ldquo;Fern,&rdquo; who read poetry during the setbreak. Fish&nbsp;was introduced as &ldquo;Showboat Gertrude&rdquo; before Terrapin; he explained that the name is derived from that of the Indian singer Shobha Gurtu.

The first round of the contest closed with a rendition of I Can&#39;t Turn You Loose. After each unsuccessful entrant was eliminated, Trey forced them to stage-dive.&nbsp; HYHU was also played briefly during the contest. First prize - free admission to all Phish shows for one year - was shared by The Bergen County Woman Cop and Captain Bong Hit.&nbsp;This show marked the first appearance of Wait, which was played three times during the show.&nbsp;During the final Wait, before Bowie, the audience was chanting &ldquo;Fuck you!&rdquo; in response. Bowie contained two <em>Charlie Chan</em> signals and Random Laugh and Oom Pa Pa signals during the jam. I Didn&rsquo;t Know featured a vacuum solo by &ldquo;Showboat Gertrude,&rdquo; which continued well into the final verse of the song.</p>\r\n",

Prior to the encore, Trey mentioned the new Minkin painting Mike&#39;s mom had given to the band. Per Fish&#39;s request, Chris Kuroda subsequently used different lights on the painting. Lawn Boy featured Trey playing The Christmas Song during his solo.
