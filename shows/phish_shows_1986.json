Russ Flanigan sat in on fiddle for parts of this show. Alumni was played by request. Letter to Jimmy Page contained quotes from Trey of \"It's alright\" before eventually returning to Alumni. Some recordings erroneously note that this show was a double-bill with The Joneses. This show contained the first known version of You Enjoy Myself, although it is possible that the correct debut was on 2/1/85, and theÂ first known performances of ZenzilÃ©'s pieces (all with Phish) Tonight, The Pendulum, Babylon is Burning, and Dec 1661. The first set of this show is identical to what is listed for 2/1/85. The setlist for 2/1/85 is possibly incorrect.",

Trey introduced the band as&nbsp;the &ldquo;Bob Dylan Band&rdquo; before they began a jam that led into&nbsp;a short All Blues (the first known Phish performance; it was only&nbsp;about a minute long). Dog Log was dedicated to all of the dogs that&nbsp;were running around, including Marley the Wonder Dog (Trey&#39;s dog). Possum included&nbsp;a Help on the Way tease.",
