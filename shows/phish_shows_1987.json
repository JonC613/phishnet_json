The songs listed as in the second set are believed to have been performed in that set, though it is unknown whether more songs were also performed in the second set, and if there was a third set as well. This show featured the first known performances of The Man Who Stepped Into Yesterday, Divided Sky, Harpua, and Bundle of Joy,Â as well as the first known Phish performance of Avenu Malkenu.Â The keyword for Makisupa was \"Woke up in the morning, dioxin on my head / Woke up in the afternoon Gaddafi in my bed.\"",

The intro to Sparks was extended while Fish&nbsp;relieved himself. McGrupp was introduced as &quot;The Gala Event.&quot; The third set was heavy on jamming and light on lyrics. Trey delivered some freestyle reggae rapping before and during the Makisupa Jam that some fans have labeled the &ldquo;Mouse House Rap.&rdquo; Mike&#39;s included a DEG tease from Trey.&nbsp;David Bowie contained a Tom Sawyer tease and was unfinished. This show contained the first known performance&nbsp;of BBFCFM and the first known Phish performance of HYHU.",
