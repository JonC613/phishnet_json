Contact), &ldquo;The Four-Track Song&rdquo; (a.k.a. Poor Heart) and &ldquo;Marijuana Hot Chocolate&rdquo; (a.k.a. Foam), for which Mike gave a preview of the bass line. The Fluffhead, Dinner and a Movie, Harry Hood, and Harpua that circulated at the end of this show are believed to have been played on March 11, 1988.",

FishÂ missed the first two sets of the gig, prompting the band to play two sets of jazz and standard Phish material in his absence with Trey on drums. These opening sets are sometimes referred to as âJazz Odyssey,â as the lone known taper labeled his master tapes as such. All Blues was played for the first time since April 25, 1986 (119Â shows). During Antelope, Trey told the story of what happened to FishÂ that evening and explained that Fish, who had been at the top of a mountain and, therefore, late for the gig, had to âRun like an Antelope, out of control.â Elsewhere in the set, Trey chided FishÂ for his tardiness. The narration in Harpua was straightforward, with no teases. Anarchy was jokingly named Whipping Post. Terrapin featured a FishÂ trombone solo. Many recordings of this show in circulation have the venue mislabeled as Fly Me to the Moon Saloon.",

Divided, Bowie, Fluffhead, and AC/DC Bag contained Sailor&#39;s Hornpipe&nbsp;teases. AC/DC Bag also contained&nbsp;London Bridge Is Falling Down, and the&nbsp;<em>Flintstones</em>&nbsp;theme teases. The third set was preceded by a First Noel tease. The second set listing might be incomplete, as the recordings that circulate cut into Bowie.",
