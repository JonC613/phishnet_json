Jokingly, Trey subsequently called the bouncers over to throw him out! Before Maze, Page read an announcement from management asking fans not to smoke in the building. Many people shouted out requests during the pause in Divided Sky, prompting Trey to scream âPOSSUM!â into the microphone. The second set started with Page again requesting that fans not smoke, while Trey and Mike launched into a few bars of Smoke on the Water, which was then introduced by Trey as Cat Scratch Fever. NICU included a Simpsons signal. Page played the first few notes of HYHU before the first Cold As Ice.Â This show marked the Phish debut of Baby Lemonade and, along with it, the first appearance of Fishâs Bag-Vac. The end of Baby Lemonade featured a tease of On Broadway. Sanity and the theme to All Things ConsideredÂ wereÂ teased before All Things Reconsidered.Â Lots of humor ensued over Mikeâs use of a cardboard cutout of Kathleen Turner from the movie <em>V.I. Warshawski</em>, which started out on top of his bass rig and ended up in front of him, giving the appearance of his head on her body. Sanity was played for the first time since May 28, 1989 (342Â shows). Memories and Carolina were performed without microphones.</p>\r\n",

Antelope contained Simpsons signals in the intro and at the end of the song as well as a Groove is in the Heart tease from Mike and an Up Up and Away signal before BBFCFM. BBFCFM subsequently contained Hawaii (The Beach Boys) quotes, a Lullaby of Birdland tease, two Get Back signals, and I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart and Complete Stop signals. The second Antelope included BBFCFM lyrics from Mike. The BBFCFM sandwich is often referred to as the âBig Black Furry Antelope.âÂ Page teased Misty before Wilson. The Secret Language Instructions featured the introductions of the Simpsons, All Fall Down, Turn Turn Turn, and Random Note signals and were preceded by an All Fall Down signalÂ in Possum and Simpsons and Turn Turn Turn signals as well as a Lazy tease from Trey upon the return to Possum. Mike used an accordion onÂ stage for the first known time during Contact. Trey also teased Lazy in Fire.</p>\r\n",

Harry Hood contained a Linus and Lucy jam; this theme was briefly reprised at the beginning of Contact. The encore featured guest Cameron McKinney on ukulele (unmiced). McKinney, seven years old at the time, also had the honor of counting off BBFCFM. It should be noted that the infamous &ldquo;squirt gun breaks&rdquo; during this show are in reference to a security guard (named Gary Herman) cooling off the audience with a Super Soaker, and not the band shooting each other. Manteca was played for the first time since March 16, 1991 (132 shows). Monitor engineer Pete Schall cracked his head open when he ran into a pole playing Band vs. Crew Football at this show, later referenced nine years later as &quot;Pete threw a bomb and he rang the pole&quot; in Trey&#39;s composition Push On &#39;Til The Day.</p>\r\n",

BBFCFM featured some zany on-stage antics that found Trey on top of his stack and Mike singing from down on the floor. The Aquarium Rescue Unit was the opening act.</p>\r\n",

    "setlist_notes": "<p>This show and its soundcheck were released by LivePhish.com in January 2010 to benefit the Haiti earthquake relief effort. Divided Sky, Antelope and Weekapaug featured teases of Those Were the Days, and Antelope also contained a Lizards tease from Trey and an All Fall Down signal. Trey sang the verses of Fee through a megaphone for the first time since October 1, 1990Â (268 shows). Phish originals Axilla, Fast Enough for You, and Lengthwise debuted at this show, which also featured the Phish debut of I Walk The Line. The start of the second set included an Owner of a Lonely Heart tease. Mikeâs Song included an Under Pressure jam as well as an Axilla tease from Mike. Weekapaug was unfinished, included a vocal jam, and ended with a tease (with lyrics) of TheÂ Price of Love. Tweezer contained an I Walk The Line tease. The BBFCFM jam did not contain the song's usual lyrics - it instead featured lyrics from both I Walk The Line and Ring of Fire, as well as a brief Ring of Fire tease (from Page). Big Ball Jam also debuted, with Trey explaining the concept of the song, adding that it was written for Pete Schall. Poor Heart, Fast Enough for You and Llama featured Gordon Stone on pedal steel guitar. Trey introduced Fish as âEyeball Manâ before Lengthwise, which was performed in more of a reggae style than other versions and even featured a vacuum solo from Fish. After Lengthwise, Page said Fish wrote the song, with Trey adding that they liked it so much that it appeared twice on the album and both Page and Trey saying \"it's that good.\" The intro to Cavern contained Axilla teases from Trey. Bold As Love was played for the first time since April 18, 1990 (320 shows).</p>\r\n",

    "setlist_notes": "This show was broadcast live (and rebroadcast in its entirety the following day) on WBCN radio. In typical Phish fashion, to make the most of this opportunity, flyers were handed out to fans walking into the show that stated that the band had come up with a bunch of new 'language' signals designed to confuse the average radio listener. The signals would be written on signs and held up by Trey at various times throughout the night. TheÂ handout explained each signal. Wilson included a Simpsons signal, I Didn't Know contained a Yay/Boo signal, Antelope included a Random Note signal, the Mockingbird narration included a Mass Hysteria signal, and Harpua included a Lip-Flop signal. Wilson and the end of Divided Sky contained <em>Jeopardy!</em> teases from Page and Antelope contained an Auld Lang Syne tease from Trey. Brad Sands was hoisted above the crowd as The Famous Mockingbird (in a chickenÂ costume) during the Mockingbird narration (about being taken underwater and turned into stone). The narration also containedÂ teases of \"Charge!\" and the theme to <em>Star Trek</em> from Page. This was the first time that Mikeâs and Weekapaug were played without Hydrogen in the middle as the band treated the audience to a fantastic New Yearâs transition. The Mikeâs combo included Trey counting down to the New Year and telling the crowd that they better make the last minute of the year a good one. Kung was played for the first time since November 2, 1989 (417Â shows). This show featured the Phish debut (and only appearance) of Diamond Girl, which featured The Dude of Life on vocals. Dressed as an old man, The Dude entered and exited the stage pushing a lawnmower. Carolina was performed without amplification.",
