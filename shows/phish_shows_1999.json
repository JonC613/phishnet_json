Trey then referenced &ldquo;the greatest songwriter of all time&rdquo; and said that he, too, grew up in the area. While some in the crowd expected Bruce Springsteen (who was in the middle of a run of 15 sold-out dates at New Jersey&rsquo;s Continental Airlines Arena), Trey produced Tom Marshall. Tom appeared in the classic <em>Born in the U.S.A</em>.-era Springsteen outfit, complete with red bandana. He subsequently sang the Phish debut of Born to Run. As the song concluded, Tom mocked a bunch of Springsteen-esque arena-rock clich&eacute;s, such as throwing his bandana into the crowd and jogging offstage to a handler who threw a towel around his shoulders. During the song he even aped some dance moves from the Dancing in the Dark video.",

During Meatstick, the crowd tried to break the world record for most people dancing at one time. Trey explained the record that the band was trying to break while Sofi Dillof danced on stage and the <em>Guinness</em> staff videotaped the crowd. Part of the Piper intro was used on the studio Piper released on <em>Farmhouse</em>. Some musical chaos ensued between Catapult and Icculus (first since October 31, 1995, or 262 shows), where Trey rambled about the negative aspects of television and the positive aspects of books and Mike teased Meatstick. The ensuing Smoke on the Water Jam included Cat Scratch Fever teases. Subsequently, Icculus was followed by more narration and a tease of Miss You. The show closed with fireworks during Hood.",

Mike subsequently took a bass solo and FishÂ sung a verse solo in a mock Jamaican accent (with a \"You roll up a big spliff and you don't pass it to no one!\" lyric). Chris took a silent light board solo (see also April 18, 1990) at Trey's request before Makisupa resumed. The second set featured multiple teases and jams, including Antelope (Stash tease), Suzy (I Wish teases and a syncopated jam based around Page), and YEM (Boogie On Reggae Woman jam). In Purple Rain, played for the first time since August 6, 1996 (210 shows), FishÂ forgot the words and subsequently thanked the crowd for supporting his vacuum cleaner habit.",

The question centered on what all of the songs played in the first set, with the exception of Driver, had in common. The answer was that all songs were in the Key of D. Happy Birthday was also played (for Trey) during the contest announcement. Cities was an appropriate choice as an encore for Memphis, and Trey altered the lyrics a bit for the occasion.</p>\r\n",

    "setlist_notes": "This was the second show of the Big Cypress festival. Fish was introduced as 'Soda Jerk' during IÂ Didnât Know.Â Split Open and MeltÂ and Disease were unfinished. Melt contained A Love Supreme teases.Â After the ensuing Catapult, Trey remarked: âOnly at the largest concert in the world could we get away with playing a song like that.â After Midnight made its Phish debut. The late set, also known as âThe Show,â began at around 11:35. âFather Timeâ was on stage, pedaling on an exercise bike that powered a large clock. The sounds of the clockâs gears could be heard through the sound system. About ten minutes before midnight, âFather Timeâ collapsed from exhaustion and the clock stopped. Then, a large fan boat entered the concert field and approached the stage. Early in its journey, the fan boat exploded away and revealed the hot dog used in the 1994 New Yearâs stunt. While the band rode the hot dog to the stage, an instrumental version of Meatstick began to play over the P.A.. The band reached the stage and fed several meatsticks to Father Time, reviving him so that the clock could continue moving toward midnight. The band then took the stage and played Meatstick to begin The Show. Dancers were on stage prior to Phish reaching it. Auld Lang Syne and Disease were accompanied by fireworks.Â Heavy Things was recorded live and rebroadcast as part of ABC televisionâs New Yearâs Eve coverage. In a humorous effort to confuse the home audience, Trey instructed the crowd to yell the word âcheesecakeâ in lieu of cheering at the end of the song. After twice giving the example of yelling the word once, Trey changed his mind and instructed the crowd to chant it, adding for them to say it like they were pissed. Trey then introduced the band for the rebroadcast and offered a message of peace and harmony for the world where he reminded people to drive in the right lane unless passing another vehicle. Meatstick was subsequently teased as the New Year approached in the central time zone. YEM included a vocal jam based around the word âcheesecakeâ and Trey altered the lyrics to Axilla and Albuquerque to reference the word. Inlaw Josie Wales featured Trey on acoustic guitar. Sand contained My Soul teasing from Mike and segued into the debut of Quadrophonic Toppling. Rock and Roll included an After Midnight tease. Love You included band introductions; FishÂ introduced Page before the song and Mike and Trey afterwards, and the band as âPhish 2000â (see November 2, 1990). Piper contained Bug teases from Page. 2001 began with the signature Hood drum roll. After the show closed with yet another version of Meatstick, the Beatles song Here Comes the Sun was piped through the crowd at sunrise. Two bustouts were played: Crosseyed and Painless (first since August 13, 1997, or 159 shows), and Love You (first since July 5, 1997, or 179 shows).",
